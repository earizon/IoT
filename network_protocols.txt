## droplit.io (Integration) [[{network.cloud,]]
* <https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2018/12/14/using-droplit-bring-cloud-edge>
* Context:
  If you’re an IoT device developer, you know the "I" in "IoT" means
  your device will, at some point, need to communicate with the cloud.

  But what if your device development expertise or schedule doesn't
  extend to cloud development?

    Enter droplit.io, a cloud-based, protocol-agnostic platform, that
  provides a rich API for integrating networked devices through the
  cloud, such as consumer wireless products, building automation
  systems, and PLCs.

## MQTT Protocol: up to x93 faster than HTTP!! [[{protocol,doc_has.comparative]]
* MQTT: Message Queue Telemetry Transport
* Binary packet payload with compressed headers of <2Bytes.
* Simple: just five API methods.
* originally developed out of IBM's pervasive computing team
  moved to open source community.
* (much) simpler that AMQP, designed for resource-constrained devices
 *LOW-BANDWIDTH/HIGH-LATENCY*  (dial up lines, LoWa, satellite links,
  marine communication...)
* Suitable for unreliable mobile connections.
  (Facebook and others are using it as part of their mobile applications).
- Extracted from: <https://medium.com/mqtt-buddy/mqtt-vs-http-which-one-is-the-best-for-iot-c868169b3105>
  """According to measurements in 3G networks, throughput of MQTT is 93 times
   faster than HTTP’s.  """
* does not define the message format at all
* Some MQTT-based brokers support THOUSANDS OF CONCURRENT DEVICE CONNECTIONS.
* It offers THREE QUALITIES OF SERVICE:
  1) fire-and-forget / unreliable: Best effort.
  2) "at least once" : ensure it is sent a minimum of one time
                       (maybe more)
  3) "exactly once".
  • It provides users with options of:
    ✓*LAST WILL TESTAMENT*: In case of unexpected disconnection of a client
                            all subscribed clients will get a message from a broker.
    ✓*RETAINED MESSAGES*  : newly subscribed client will get an immediate
                            status update.
  *WARN: HTTP Protocol has none of these abilities.*

## Zigbee.org  Protocol [[{network.mesh,protocol.zigbee]]
* <https://www.zigbee.org/>
* IEEE 802.15.4-based specification for a suite of high-level
  communication protocols used to create personal area networks with
  small, low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, ...
* Zigbee PRO 2023 new security mechanisms and enhancements 
  <https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2023/04/12/zigbee-pro-2023-security-mechanisms/>
   The key new security features include Dynamic Link Key, Device 
  Interview, and Trust Center Swap Out. Dynamic Link Key is a 
  significant improvement based on Public/Private key pairing and 
  advanced security curves, further protecting the network from 
  attacks. Device Interview technology allows users to query and filter 
  out the devices before allowing them onto a network based on 
  ecosystem requirements. The Trust Center Swap-Out feature allows 
  changing out the ‘Trust Center’ which can be a gateway, hub, smart 
  speaker, and even commercial electric meters for a network without 
  requiring all devices to be recommissioned

## Narrow-band [[{network.101,network.wireless,]]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband>
* In radio, narrowband describes a channel in which the bandwidth of the
  message does not significantly exceed the channel's coherence bandwidth.

* In the study of wired channels, narrowband implies that the channel under
  consideration is sufficiently narrow that its frequency response can be
  considered flat. The message bandwidth will therefore be less than the
  coherence bandwidth of the channel. That is, no channel has perfectly flat
  fading, but the analysis of many aspects of wireless systems is greatly
  simplified if flat fading can be assumed.

* Narrowband can also be used with the audio spectrum to describe sounds which
  occupy a narrow range of frequencies.

* In telephony, narrowband is usually considered to cover frequencies 300–3400 Hz.

## Sigfox Global Low Power WAN [[{network.wireless.lora,]]
<https://www.sigfox.com/en>
<https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellnex_Telecom>
- Sigfox Global Low Power Wide Area Network drastically brings down cost
  and energy consumption required for securely connecting IoT sensors
  to the Cloud.
- With its simple approach to connectivity, Sigfox provides extremely price-
  competitive connectivity subscriptions and even more importantly, enables
  extremely simple and cost-efficient silicon modules.

- Provider for other companies. Example:

## Z-Wave [[{use_case.domotic,protocol.z-wave,network.mesh,]]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave>
* wireless communications protocol used primarily for home automation.
* It is a mesh network using low-energy radio waves to communicate
  from appliance to appliance, allowing for wireless control of residential
  appliances and other devices, such as lighting control, security systems,
  thermostats, windows, locks, swimming pools and garage door openers.
* Like other protocols and systems aimed at the home and office automation
  market, a Z-Wave automation system can be controlled from a wireless keyfob,
  a wall-mounted keypad or through smartphones, tablets or computers, with a Z-
  Wave gateway or central control device serving as both the hub controller and
  portal to the outside. It provides interoperability between home
  control systems of different manufacturers that are a part of its alliance.
  There are a growing number of interoperable Z-Wave products; over 1,700 in
  2017, and over 2,400 by 2018.

## LPWAN [[{network.lpwan,]]
<https://www.qwant.com/?q=LPWA++wikipedia>
* A low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) or low-power wide-area
  (LPWA) network or low-power network (LPN) is a type of wireless
  telecommunication wide area network designed to allow long range
  communications at a low bit rate among things (connected objects),
  such as sensors operated on a battery. The low power, low bit
  rate and intended use distinguish this type of network from a
  wireless WAN that is designed to connect users or businesses, and
  carry more data, using more power. The LPWAN data rate ranges from
  0.3 kbit/s to 50 kbit/s per channel.

* A LPWAN may be used to create a private wireless sensor network,
  but may also be a service or infrastructure offered by a third party,
  allowing the owners of sensors to deploy them in the field without
  investing in gateway technology.

* what is lpwa for the IoT (part-1)?

## Narrowband IoT
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband_IoT>
Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) radio
technology standard developed by 3GPP to enable a wide range of cellular
devices and services.[1][2] The specification was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 (
LTE Advanced Pro), in June 2016.[3] Other 3GPP IoT technologies include eMTC (
enhanced Machine-Type Communication) and EC-GSM-IoT.[4]

## Apache plc4x  [[{]]
https://plc4x.apache.org/, Universal Protocol Adapter for Industrial IoT

"""While with OPC-UA every device has to be retrofitted with the
ability to speak a new protocol and use a common client to speak with
these devices, PLC4X tries to provide a unified API by implementing
drivers for communicating with most industrial controllers in the
protocols they natively understand."""

Each of these drivers is being implemented from the specs or by
reverse engineering protocols in order to be fully Apache 2.0
licensed.

The*major benefits*of PLC4X™ over OPC-UA, from our point of view are:
  - No need to modify existing hardware
  - Activating OPC-UA support on existing PLCs greatly increases the load on the PLCs
  - No need to pay for licenses to activate OPC-UA support

- At first we will be concentrating on providing adapters for the most widely used
  protocol such as:

## Multicast DNS: [[{protocol.multicast_dns,]]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS>
* multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol resolves host names to IP addresses
  within small networks lacking a local name server.
* ZERO-CONFIGURATION SERVICE, using essentially the same
  programming interfaces, packet formats and operating semantics as
  the unicast Domain Name System (DNS).
* Although Stuart Cheshire designed mDNS as an stand-alone protocol,
  it can work in concert with standard DNS servers.

* The mDNS protocol is published as RFC 6762, uses IP multicast User Datagram
  Protocol (UDP) packets, and is implemented by the Apple Bonjour and open
  source Avahi software packages. Android contains an mDNS implementation.
  mDNS has also been implemented in Windows 10, but its use there is limited to
  discovering networked printers.

* mDNS can work in conjunction with DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), a companion
  zero-configuration technique specified separately in RFC 6763.

## LoRa(WAN) [[{network.101,network.wireless.LoRa,]]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa>
LoRa (Long Range) is a patented[1] digital wireless data communication
technology developed by Cycleo of Grenoble, France, and acquired by Semtech
in 2012.[2] LoRa is a long-range wireless communication protocol that competes
against other low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) wireless such as narrowband
IoT (NB IoT) or LTE Cat M1. Compared to those, LoRa achieves its extremely
long range connectivity, possible 100km+, by trading off data rate. Because
its data rates are below 50kbps and because LoRa is limited by duty cycle and
other restrictions, it is suitable in practice for non-real time applications
in which one can tolerate delays.[3]

## LoRaWAN security
<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321362926_Using_blockchain_to_build_trusted_LoRaWAN_sharing_server>
* LoRaWAN protocol is equipped with AES symmetric crypto protection,
  with well-known  keys to IoT node and network gateway
  mutual authentication, integrity protection and confidentiality.
  providing both signing and encryption for parts of network packages.
  KEY DISTRIBUTION depends on how IoT node joins the network:
  * node allowed entry through ABP:
    IoT node comes preinstalled with 'DevAddr' and both communication unique
    session keys:
    - network session key (NwkSKey): network layer security.
    - app     session key (AppSKey): application layer end-to-end security.
    Gateway must have the information and keys they need.
  * OTAA:
    - each IoT node comes preinstalled  with a unique 128-bit AppKey,
      used to sign the (un-encrypted) "join-request" message that
      includes the end node's unique:
      ```
      [ AppEUI, DevEUI , DevNonce ] + 4bytes signature using AppKey
        |       |         └ random (2bytes) DevNonce
        |       └---------- Should be globally unique identifier for the device
        └------------------ Should be unique to owner-of-device(or IoT solution)
      ```
      On reception the gateway should check the values and then
      recheck signature using the share AppKey responding with a "join-accept"
      The gateway generates also a new AppNonce and calculates the end node's two
      new 128-bit keys: the AppSKey and the NwkSKey.<br/>
   After joining, all future messages will be encrypted and signed.

* PROBLEM: How do we trust gateway in public WANs?

## Chiprstack LoRaWAN Network Server  [[{]]
* <https://github.com/chirpstack/chirpstack>
* OOSS LoRaWAN Network Server which can be used
  to to setup LoRaWAN networks.
* Includes web-interface for the management of gateways,
  devices and tenants as well to setup data
  integrations with the major cloud providers,
  databases and services commonly used for handling
  device data.
* gRPC & REST API.
* Class-A end-device support: allow for bi-directional communications
  whereby each end-device‘s uplink transmission is followed by two
  short downlink receive windows. The transmission slot scheduled by
  the end-device is based on its own communication needs with a small
  variation based on a random time basis (ALOHA-type of protocol).

* Class-B end-device support: allow for more receive slots. In
  addition to the Class A random receive windows, Class B devices open
  extra receive windows at scheduled times. In order for the End-device
  to open it receive window at the scheduled time it receives a time
  synchronized Beacon from the gateway.

* Class-C end-device support: have nearly continuously open receive
  windows, only closed when transmitting. Class C end-device will use
  more power to operate than Class A or Class B but they offer the
  lowest latency for server to end-device communication.

* Adaptive data-rate: When the end-device has ADR enabled, the
  ChirpStack LoRaWAN network-server will ensure that the device will
  operate using the most efficient data-rate and tx-power. this will
  not only save energy at the device-side, but will also optimize the
  usage of the radio spectrum, lowering the risk of collisions.

* Live frame-logging: The ChirpStack LoRaWAN application-server
  provides live frame-logging per gateway and device. It will display
  all the RX / TX meta-data, together with the raw LoRaWAN PHYPayload
  in a readable format. It is like Wireshark for LoRaWAN!

* Channel (re)configuration: Whether you want to use a sub-set of the
  LoRaWAN defined channels (e.g. for the US band) or want to configure
  additional channels (e.g. for the EU band), the ChirpStack LoRaWAN
  network-server will make sure the device stays always in sync with
  the network configured channels (using the CFList field and / or
  mac-commands).

* Multi-tenant: The ChirpStack LoRaWAN application-server supports
  the creation of multiple organizations to which (administrator) users
  can be assigned. By integrating the user-accounts into the MQTT
  broker authentication, organizations will only see their own data.

* LoRaWAN 1.0 and 1.1 compatible including all LoRaWAN Regional Parameter
  Specification revisions and bands.

* In general, TWO MAIN CATEGORIES OF NETWORKS ARE USED IN THE IOT:
  * short-range/low-power:
    IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are
    considered to be a crucial network and will account for the majority
     of IoT devices.
  * long-range/low-power :(LPWAN).
    LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players.
    In general they are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints.
    (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited
    resources).
