* C&P from https://www.linkedin.com/:
  I'm happy to complete the RTL to GDSII flow of my first tape-out
  using completely open-source IC design tools as my graduation project
  under supervision of Prof. Ali Ziya Alkar. It was a really important
  experience for my career at an undergraduate level. I have used the
  Google sponsored SkyWater Technology Foundry PDKs to implement an AES
  Accelerator with Efabless Corporation's Caravel SoC. Hopefully I will
  obtain a solid chip form of the design by submitting this project to
  Efabless Corporation next MPW Program.I would like to express my
  sincere thanks to Vijayan Krishnan for his kind help, also to
  Muhammet Bahadır Türkoğlu and Berk Kışınbay from Yongatek
  Microelectronics for guidance through design.

* The RPi USB Hub Module utilises an USB-to-UART/MPSSE IC, along with a GL850G
  USB hub controller IC. It provides engineers with up to 4 downstream USB 2.0
  Hi-Speed (480Mbit/s) ports. Asynchronous serial data transfer rates from 300
  bits/s to 12 Mbits/s at 3.3 V TTL levels are supported, while synchronous
  serial data rates of up to 30 Mbits/s can be dealt with on JTAG, SPI and I2C interfaces.
