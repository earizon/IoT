# 101

## All IoT Devs. are doomed [[{security.101,qa.101]]
* <https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-your-iot-devices-are-doomed/>
* Until we look to emulate the open models of Wi-Fi and PCs, IoT will
  always be a source of never-ending e-waste.
* The problem is not as simple as IoTs and the companies supporting
  them going belly-up. It's more along the lines of the vendors
  themselves being willfully negligent in providing a path to community
  support for these devices and penalizing their early adopters.

## i2c bus [[{101,hardware.bus.i2c,]]
* i2c interconnect-to-circuit bus
* <https://github.com/jamesbowman/i2cdriver>
* I2CDriver: tool for controlling any I2C device from your PC's USB
  port, and can also monitor and capture I2C traffic. It connects as a
  standard USB serial device, so there are no drivers to install. On
  the main site i2cdriver.com, there are drivers for

## HomeCMOS [[{]]
* HomeCMOS project is dedicated to developing hobbyist-friendly
  processes for the microfabrication of CMOS and MEMS devices,
  providing documentation for these under the BSD open source licence.
  The project may be some way from being able to produce a usable IC,
  but the team has had success with a number of processes that make use
  of easily available materials, and have demonstrated etching a 600um
  long image into 200nm thick copper film."
* ... The HomeCMOS team has yet to actually make an integrated circuit or
  MEMS device, [Jeri Ellsworth] has shown this is possible by making
  transistors and integrated circuits at home. While there won’t be
  chips with millions of transistors coming out of the HomeCMOS lab
  anytime soon, it’s more than possible to see a few small-scale
  integration-level tech such as a few logic gates or a regulator.

## pregnant chip: As powerful as first IBM PCs [[{]]
* 2 photosensors + 2 LEDs + LCD + battery + mCPU.

 "... When the wick gets wet, it starts conducting electricity, and 
  this device turns on..."

## 101 código morse
* radioaficionados demostraron en 1956 que tan solo 78 milivatios 
puede ser energía suficiente para transmitir desde Massachusetts a 
Dinamarca utilizando código morse.
