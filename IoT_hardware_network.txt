# Hardware for Communication and Networks

## BeagleConnect™ Freedom [[{hardware.network.beagleconnect,OS.Zephyr,OS.micropython,PM.low_cost]]
* <https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beagleconnect-freedom> 
* 2x mikroBUS connections. 
* over 1,000 different add-on options. 
* On-board sensors include temperature, humidity and light level.
* battery charger to assist with battery-backed-up designs.
* Based on the Texas Instruments SimpleLink™ CC1352P7 wireless
  microcontroller running Zephyr and Micropython, utilizing the
  2.4GHz and sub-1GHz IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks are made easy.
* BeagleConnect™ is a revolutionary technology virtually eliminating  
  low-level software development for IoT and IIoT applications, such as 
  building automation, factory automation, and home automation. [[{PM.low_cost}]]
* Choosing BeagleConnect™ simplifies development by eliminating the 
  need for layer of software development.  
* While numerous IoT and IIoT solutions available today provide 
  massive software libraries for microcontrollers supporting a limited 
  body of sensors, actuators and indicators as well as libraries for 
  communicating over various networks, BeagleConnect™ simply eliminates 
  the need for these libraries by shifting the burden into the most 
  massive and collaborative software project of all time, the Linux 
  kernel. [[{doc_has.keypoint}]]

## Aluminum-coated fiber-optic sensors promise to monitor industrial facility conditions [[{sensors.structure,use_case.industrial,year.2023]]
<https://insights.globalspec.com/article/19871/aluminum-coated-fiber-optic-sensors-promise-to-monitor-industrial-facility-conditions>
  A team of researchers from Russia’s Skolkovo Institute of Science
  and Technology (Skoltech) has developed a system of aluminized
  fiber-optic sensors for the purpose of monitoring the structural
  health and condition of industrial facilities.k
  Placed within a distillation tower, the sensors could reportedly
  monitor the structural health of the tower, thereby avoiding
  extensive repairs and allowing for early interventions. Currently,
  when issues arise within a distillation tower, the metal of the tower
  has to be cut open and a person is deployed with a mop inside to
  investigate and clean the tower in hopes that it will fix the issue.

## CaribouLite Software Defined Radio [[{network.SDR.CaribouLite,price.to_300€]]
* <https://github.com/cariboulabs/cariboulite>
* affordable, educational, open-source SDR evaluation platform 
  and a HAT for the Raspberry-Pi family of boards (40-pin 
  versions only). 
* Built for makers, hackers, and researchers and designed to
  complement the current SDR (Software Defined Radio) 
  eco-systems offering with a scalable, standalone dual-channel 
  software-defined radio.

## Project OWL: Disaster Relief IoT firmware [[{network.wireless.lora.OWL,use_case.disaster_relief,]]>
* <https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-foundation-open-sources-disaster-relief-iot-firmware-project-owl/>
* OWL stands for Organization, Whereabouts, and Logistics using
  DuckLinks (IoT)  to create a combined Wi-Fi + LoRa (about 10Km) cellular
  network.
* Ham radio has long also served this purpose. But Amateur Radio 
  Emergency Service (ARES) personnel require training and they may not 
  be immediately available to help in some areas. DuckLinks are meant 
  to be easy to deploy and use.
* It also provides with analytics to facilitate organization, 
  whereabouts, and logistics.

## NM1801100 LoRa Bluethooth 5 [[{network.wireless.loRa,protocol.bluetooth,hardware.network,]]
* <https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/12/NM180100-ultra-low-energy-iot/>
- low power consumption in all operating states
  (computing/transmitting/receiving/deep sleep)
- versatile communication capabilities
- According to Northern Mechatronics, it consumes 10 times
  less power than comparable products, with an advertised
  consumption of 6uA/MHz for the processor, and between
  2 and 2.7uA in the sleep state. [[{doc_has.comparative}]]
- 1 MB of on-module flash memory
- 384 kB of static random-access memory.
- two radio stacks on simultaneously:
  - short-range Bluetooth 5 Low Energy (BLE)
  - low-power wide-area network (LoRaWAN)
  with memory still left on the device for
  computing purposes and over-the-air firmware updates.
- The Apollo3 Blue (ARM® Cortex® M4 with FPU up to 96MHz)
- The Bluetooth customary range goes from
  - below 10m (Bluetooth class 3)
  - up to 100m (Bluetooth class 1).
- In contrast, *LoRa claims a physical range beyond 10 km*.
- The combination of both technologies facilitates both edge and endpoint computing.
