## Sensor tracking firefighters [[{hardware.sensors.motion}]]
* <https://insights.globalspec.com/article/11310/researchers-create-sensor-capable-of-tracking-firefighters-in-burning-buildings>
* Researchers at Canada’s McMaster University in collaboration with 
  other universities have developed a motion-powered and fire-proof 
  sensor capable of tracking the movements of those working in 
  high-risk professions including firefighting, mining and steel 
  working.
* The inexpensive sensor, which is roughly the size of a button-cell 
  watch battery, can fit easily into the sole of a boot or under the 
  arm of a jacket — any location where motion produces a pattern of 
  consistent contact and release to power the sensor. In other words, 
  the sensor relies on triboelectric (or friction-generated) charging, 
  taking electricity from movement the way one might when moving over a 
  carpeted surface wearing socks and picking up static electricity.

<https://www.networkworld.com/article/3233309/how-to-build-low-cost-iot-sensor-networks.html>
* <./SensorFusionForPublicSpaceUtilizationMonitoringInASmartCity.pdf> is simply the best
  read for IoT product designers, developers and implementers.
  Original Source: <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01581>
* Sound sensors over video sensors were chosen ... Cameras are computationally expensive,
* Renewable Wide Area Sensor Network (RWSN) eliminates hardwired power and
  battery replacement.
  It uses low-power XBee transmitter modules (IEEE 802.15.4 ) to interconnect the sensors
  to the Xbee receiver. Raspberry Pi used as backhaul.
  Using Xbee relays, researchers built a wireless mesh network to increase coverage.
  An Environmental Monitoring Sensor Node, including a barometer,
  thermometer, light intensity, resistive rain, ultra-violet (UV)
  index, humidity, motion, and noise sensors, is included in the
  network to provide calibration data to remove the effects of
  environmental conditions, such as rain interfering with sound
  readings.
* Inexpensive Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) sensors, also known as
  passive infrared sensors, were used to detect motion. And inexpensive
  analog sound sensors, essentially microphones, were used to record
  sound.
