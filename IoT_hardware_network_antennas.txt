## GPS Timing Antennas [[{hardware.antennas,sensors.gps,]]

* GPS Timing Antennas and Portable UFH Antenna offer High Levels of
  Precision and Performance In many applications, across a wide range
  of industries, the need for network time synchronization and
  precision frequency reference is required.
* Additionally in many test and monitoring applications the need for high performance,
  field tunable UHF antennas is essential.

* To address these applications we have just released a new line of
  GPS Timing Antennas and a portable UHF Antenna.
  Features Include:
  * 1575-1610 MHz Frequency Range (GPS Antennas)
  * High Selectivity Dual Filter RF Architecture (GPS Antennas)
  * Outdoor-Rated Design
  * 118-174 MHz Frequency Range (UHF Antenna)
  * Telescopic Radiator (UHF Antenna)
  * Field tunable (UHF Antenna)

## L-Com WiFi/MIMO/CBRS Antennas [[{use_case.fleet_tracking,hardware.antennas,network.wireless,]]
* L-com Introduces New Antennas to Address Wi-Fi 6/6e, MIMO and CBRS Applications
  "...  We have just launched a new series of directional flat panel
   and omnidirectional antennas to address a wide range of wireless
   connectivity applications.

   These new antennas offer high-performance and throughput while
   supporting frequencies from 617 MHz to 7.2 GHz covering applications
   including IoT, public safety, connected cars, fleet management, 5G
   and cellular networks.
