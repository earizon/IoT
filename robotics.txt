Open Source Robotics: Getting Started with Gazebo and ROS 2
    Dolly is virtual robot sheep that serves as a practical introduction to Gazebo and ROS 2.
    The Robot Operating System's latest version, ROS 2, offers familiar tools and capabilities, while expanding to new use cases.
    Gazebo is a powerful robot simulator used by industry and academia that calculates physics, generates sensor data and provides convenient interfaces.
    Open source software is lowering the barrier to entry and speeding up progress in robotics.
    Roboticists all around the world are leveraging Gazebo and ROS in applications ranging from humanoids and drones to warehouse robots and self-driving cars.

Project website: https://rofi.fi.muni.cz/

RoFI is a platform of modular robots developed at Faculty of
Informatics at Masaryk University. The platform is designed for
building larger robots (RoFIbots) from a small number of module types.

The modules of the platform can connect together using RoFI dock.
Mechanically connected modules can communicate over TCP/IP and share
power.

For an in-depth description of the RoFI platform see the project
website.

## Automotive Stepping Motor Driver IC: Toshiba TB9120AFTG 
* <https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/eu/semiconductor/product/automotive-devices/automotive-stepping-motor-driver-ics/articles/automotive-stepping-motor-driver-icic-tb9120aftg.html>
* Toshiba Electronic Devices & Storage Corporation
* constant-current 2-phase bipolar stepping motor driver IC capable 
  of generating microstepped sine waves only from an input clock 
  signal, eliminating the need for a high-performance MCU and software.
* The AEC-Q100-compliant TB9120AFTG driver IC incorporates low 
  on-resistance DMOS FETs, and can deliver a 1.5A (maximum) current. 
  Thanks to the large number of micro-steps supported, motor noise can 
  be significantly reduced, with applications benefitting from smoother 
  operation and more precise control.
* built-in mixed decay mode helps to stabilize the current waveforms 
  and numerous protection mechanisms are incorporated including 
  over-current and over-temperature detection, plus thermal shutdown. 
* There is also a stall detection function.
* supplied in a compact VQFN package (with 6.0 mm x 6.0mm dimensions) 
  featuring wettable flanks to allow the use of automated optical
  inspection (AOI) for ensuring the quality of solder joints.
* Supports an operational temperature range covering -40°C to 125°C.
* Key applications include HUD mirror control,  HVAC -(H)eating, (V)entilation, (A)ir(C)onditioning- applications, and engine Idle Speed Control.

##  Fedora Robotics [[{os.fedora.robotics,]]
* <https://labs.fedoraproject.org/robotics/>
* Fedora Robotics spin provides a wide variety of free and open 
  robotics software packages. These range from hardware accessory 
  libraries for the Hokuyo laser scanners or Katana robotic arm to 
  software frameworks like Fawkes or Player and simulation environments 
  such as Stage and RoboCup Soccer Simulation Server 2D/3D. 
* It also provides a ready to use development environment for robotics 
  including useful libraries such as OpenCV computer vision library, 
  Festival text to speech system and MRPT.
* The Robotics spin is targeted at people just discovering their 
  interest in robotics as well as experienced roboticists.
* For the former we provide a readily usable simulation environment with an 
  introductory hands-on demonstration, and for the latter we provide a 
  full development environment, to be used immediately.
