* Now putting that all together could be a project for an organization
  to do on its own, or they can engage from a growing ecosystem of
  vendors. Among those vendors is FreedomFi, led by the former
  co-founder of OpenStack vendor Mirantis. On Oct. 19, FreedomFi
  announced that it was launching an appliance that helps to enable 5G
  - and it's only $300.

  About this webinar
    One of the many capabilities operators will be rolling out along
  with their 5G network enhancements is the delivery of Edge-based
  low-latency applications, improving network connectivity for
  enterprise applications, massive numbers of devices, and IoT
  services. The implementation of these new high-availability services
  will increasingly demand zero-touch provisioning and simplified
  network management.
