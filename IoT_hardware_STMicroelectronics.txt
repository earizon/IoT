# STMicroelectronics next-generation microcontroller range

* STMicroelectronics announced launch of next-gen. wireless components
for extra slim consumer devices such as wearables, health monitors
and "smart" objects. ... supports short-range wavelengths 
including Zigbee, Bluetooth and Thread[[{PM.TODO}]], with the latter
appealing to smart utility meter operators and smart buildings. 
... flagship product: STM32WBA55 with several connectivity modes,
(BT LE 5.4 and Matter, Zigbee and Thread).<br/>
... Matter border router networks use the Matter standard [[{PM.TODO}]]
as a low-power Wi-Fi alternative, connecting sensors and other IoT
units in a single mesh setup.<br/>
  ... STM32WBA5 intended to house all wireless functionalities on a 
single chip ... accessible via development software in the existing
STM32 microcontroller ecosystem.

# STM32 uController

* Warn: STM32 (2005, by STM Microele.) looks to be "deprecated" in 
  favor of the newer ESP32 (2016, by Espriff).

## STM32 embedded Soft [[{hardware.mcpu.stm32,]]
* <https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software.html>
- Low-level drivers, hardware abstraction layers, and middleware
  including RTOS, USB, TCP/IP, and graphic stacks, are indispensable
  bricks for a fast and efficient application development.

* For STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors, ST proposes a large
  range of embedded software components including:
  - Audio (MP3, WMA, voice services, and more)
  - Connectivity (USB, TCP/IP, Bluetooth, Zigbee RF4CE, and more)
  - Graphical interfaces
  - Cryptography (Free STM32 Library with public key, symmetric and hash algorithms)
  - Motor Control and Safety (IEC 61508 SIL for industrial, IEC/UL
    60335/60730 Class B for Home Appliance applications)
